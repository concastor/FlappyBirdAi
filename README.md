# FlappyBirdAi

Project moreso designed to test and display how my neural network library can work.

each generation of birds contain 50 entities each with a neaural network with random values inside. as they fly the ones that
make it the farthest are rated higher and thier genes are modifed and passed on to the next generation(thier colours are slight 
varitions on thier parents)

The inputs for the nerual network are the height from the groud, the distance to the pipe and the y values of the top and bottom
of the pipe.
